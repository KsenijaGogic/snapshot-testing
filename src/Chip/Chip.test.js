// We'll need to import React, as we're generating components

// We'll need to import a name helper called mount from 'enzyme'

// And we'll need to import a default helper called toJson from 'enzyme-to-json'


// We'll import our component here


// And we'll define our test here, using the global "it" helper
// The first argument is a string that will help is _describe_ our test
// The second argument is a function that the test will run
