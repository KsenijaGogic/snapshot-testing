// Because we're testing JUST a function here, we'll need to import that and nothing else

// Here we'll start with out "it" block
// Remember that the first argument is a string that describes our test
// And the second is the function we'll run that will determine if this test passes or fails

// Within our test block, what we want to test are the following cases:
// 1. Does it successfully identify a hex code? Think of all the different permutations of a valid hex code.
// 2. Does it successfully identify a non-hex code? Let's try being cheeky and using rgb().
